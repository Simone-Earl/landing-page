      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Brew Point Cafe is a locally owned coffee shop that takes pride in sourcing organic beans, crafting flavorful blends, and offering a cozy spot for community connection. We believe coffee is more than a beverage — it’s a culture, a ritual, and a way to bring people together.
